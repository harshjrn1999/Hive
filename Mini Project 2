Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
 
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

Note: Consider only the year 2017 for analysis and not the Fiscal year.

Now insert the data into the parted and bucketed table from the violations parking table

insert into park_viol_part_buck partition(Violation_County) select
Summons_Number,Plate_ID,Registration_State,Plate_Type,Issue_Date,Violation_Code,
Vehicle_Body_Type,Vehicle_Make,Issuing_Agency,Street_Code1,Street_Code2,

Violation_Description,No_Standing_or_Stopping_Violation,Hydrant_Violation,
Double_Parking_Violation,Violation_County from violations_parking
where year(Issue_Date) = '2017';

Part-I: Examine the data

 1. Find the total number of tickets for the year.

select count(distinct Summons_Number) Tickets_Total ,year(Issue_Date) as year from park_viol_part_buck group by year(Issue_Date);

5432898   2017

2. Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.

select count(distinct Registration_State) as No_of_States from park_viol_part_buck;
select Registration_State, Count(1) as Number_of_Records from park_viol_part_buck  group by Registration_State order by Number_of_Records;

65

3. Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )

select count(distinct summons_number) as No_Tickets_without_address from violations_parking  where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;

3667515

 Part-II: Aggregation tasks

 1.How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)

select count(Violation_Code) as frequency_of_violation,Violation_Code from park_viol_part_buck group by Violation_Code order by frequency_of_violation desc limit 5;

768276  21
662760  36
542088  38
476756  14
319720  20

 2. How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)

select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket  from park_viol_part_buck group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5;

SUBN     1884255
4DSD     1547293
VAN     724142
DELV     359069
SDN     194597

select Vehicle_Make,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket from park_viol_part_buck group by Vehicle_Make order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5; 

FORD     636948
TOYOT     605395
HONDA     538987
NISSA     462108
CHEVR     356095

3. A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
a. Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)

select Violation_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from violations_parking group by  Violation_Precinct order by IssuedTicket desc limit 5;

0     2072400
19     535671
14     352450
1     331810
18     306920

b. Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
select Issuer_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from violations_parking group by Issuer_Precinct order by IssuedTicket desc limit 5;

0     2388475
19     521513
14     344977
1     321170
18     296554

4. Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?

select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck  group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;

0  36     662760
0     7     210171
0     21     126218
18     14     50159
19     46     48451

It will not make any sense to consider '0', therefore 18,19 and 14 are the three issuer precincts which have the maximum number of violations.

Issuer Precinct 18:
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=18 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
14     50159
69     20189
47     14107
31     11894
46     7872
42     6190
38     6176

Issuer Precinct 19:
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=19 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
46     48451
38     36386
37     36056
14     29797
21     28413
20     14629
40     11416

Issuer Precinct 14:
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_buck where Issuer_Precinct=14 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
14     45041
69     30464
31     22555
47     18364
42     10027
46     7686
19     7030

5. Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(regexp_extract(violation_time,'(.*)[A-Z]',1),'HHmm'),"HH:mm") as data from violations_parking limit 7;
01:43
04:00
12:11
12:17
12:07
10:37
01:01

select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(violation_time,'M'), 'HHmmaaa'),"HH:mmaaa") as data from violations_parking limit 7;
01:43AM
04:00AM
12:11PM
12:17PM
12:07PM
10:37AM
01:01AM

6. Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
Create a Partitioned View as views take less space as compared to tables:

create view park_viol_part_view partitioned on (Violation_Code) as
select Summons_Number, Violation_Time, Issuer_Precinct,
case
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','12') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 1
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 2
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='A' then 3
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('12','00','01','02','03') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P' then 4


elect Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 2 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
14     74121
40     60662
21     57928

Bin = 3
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 3 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
21     598183
36     348161
38     176573

Bin = 4
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 4 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
36     286283
38     240721
37     167026

Bin = 5
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 5 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
38     102858
14     75919
37     70345

Bin = 6
select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 6 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
7     26292
40     22361
14     21055

7. Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
select Violation_Time_bin, count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Code in (21,36,37,38) group by Violation_Time_bin order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
3     1173323
4     768743
5     186997

8. Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
a. First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
create view tickets_issued_view as
select Violation_Code , Issuer_Precinct,
case
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 03 and 05 then 'spring'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 06 and 08 then 'summer'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 09 and 11 then 'autumn'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) in (1,2,12) then 'winter'
else 'unknown' end  as season 
from violations_parking;
Create a partitioned view of the above view, again to increase the query execution performance...

create view tickets_issued_view_part partitioned on (Violation_Code) as
select Issuer_Precinct,
case
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 03 and 05 then 'spring'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 06 and 08 then 'summer'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 09 and 11 then 'autumn'
when MONTH(Issue_Date) in (1,2,12) then 'winter'
else 'unknown' end  as season,Violation_Code from
violations_parking;
select season, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part group by season order by TicketsIssued desc;
Spring     2958420
Winter     1562390
Summer     855690
autumn     0

b. Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part where season = 'spring' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
21     401250
36     365231
38     265859

select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part where season = 'summer' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
21     234562
36     222369
38     181258

select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part where season = 'autumn' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
21     136521
36     95365
38     83321

select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from tickets_issued_view_part where season = 'winter' group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;

when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('04','05','06','07') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P' then 5
when substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('08','09','10','11') and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))='P'then 6
else null end as Violation_Time_bin,Violation_Code
from park_viol_part_buck
where Violation_Time is not null or (length(Violation_Time)=5 and upper(substring(Violation_Time,-1))in ('A','P')
and substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','04','05','06','07', '08','09','10','11','12'));

select Violation_Code,count(*) TicketsIssued from park_viol_part_view where Violation_Time_bin == 1 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;
21     36976
40     25897
78     15550
0     5     48072
14     14     45041
